# Software Design/Engineering

The artifact created is the combination of Project One and Project Two that performed reverse engineering of assembly language to C++, and to create a .out file to execute the projects from CS 410: Reverse Engineering. What the artifact consists of is a multitude of files that demonstrate proficiency in reverse engineering criteria of the Software Design and Engineering category. The original artifact was created in April of 2021. The time when this artifact was created was determined to be later within the program, which shows my commitment to enhancing more advanced projects. The artifact was enhanced where the C++ language was converted to the C language, and the .out file for the Linux operating system was converted to a .exe file for the Windows operating system. 


The original artifact functionality consisted of reversing a binary file to the C++ language using the Bless Hex Editor. The binary file was translated to assembly, and was prepared for being converted to C++. The C++ language file was then converted to a .out binary file for the software product to be executed on Linux systems. The compiler used when reverse engineering the original binary files was the GNU compiler, which is suited for Linux systems. The original artifact contains several methods: a main method, a ChangeCustomerChoice method, a CheckUserPermissionAccess method, and a DisplayInfo method. These methods are not reusable and contain object-oriented practices. In addition to reverse engineering, the purpose of this project was to verify the authentication and authorization of a user's account when a user purchases a product online. The functionality of this artifact is illustrated below.

The inclusion of the artifact in my ePortfolio is justified through factors where reverse engineering includes the ability to design requirements and to use software engineering principles to demonstrate interoperability. Why I decided to select this item is due to the ability to demonstrate the design of a product, the proficiency in the C language, the proficiency in converting software products from Linux to Windows, and the proficiency in following a lifecycle. The specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in software development include the code segments that will contain memory deallocation and storage security for each method, the methods that were transferred to a different language, and the .exe file that determines the reverse engineering for a different operating system. How the artifact was improved was through the implementation of C coding standards that secured the input validation of each method, changing the original C++ code and .cpp file to C code and a .c file, as well as compiling the project to a .exe file for the Windows operating system. The artifact chosen is suited for the ePortfolio due to the improvements made concerning software design and engineering. 

The functionality of the enhanced artifact includes using the enhancement objectives. The enhancement objectives consisted of reverse engineering a project for a different operating system and transferring a project into a different language. These enhancements were performed within the existing code segments, where each segment was transferred into a different language and the entire project was reverse-engineered for a different operating system. The enhanced features include refining the methods and creating deallocated code segments for each method using C coding standards. This functionality refines the artifact to be a more optimized software product.
