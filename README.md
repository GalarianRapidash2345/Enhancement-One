# Software Design/Engineering

The artifact created is the combination of Project One and Project Two that performed reverse engineering of assembly language to C++, and to create a .out file to execute the projects from CS 410: Reverse Engineering. What the artifact consists of is a multitude of files that demonstrate proficiency in reverse engineering criteria of the Software Design and Engineering category. The original artifact was created in April of 2021. The time when this artifact was created was determined to be later within the program, which shows my commitment to enhancing older projects. The artifact was enhanced where the C++ language was converted to the C language, and the .out file for the Linux operating system was converted to a .exe file for the Windows operating system.
