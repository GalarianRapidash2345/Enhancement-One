# Software Design/Engineering

The artifact created is the combination of Project One and Project Two that performed reverse engineering of assembly language to C++, and to create a .out file to execute the projects from CS 410: Reverse Engineering. What the artifact consists of is a multitude of files that demonstrate proficiency in reverse engineering criteria of the Software Design and Engineering category. The original artifact was created in April of 2021. The time when this artifact was created was determined to be later within the program, which shows my commitment to enhancing more advanced projects. The artifact was enhanced where the C++ language was converted to the C language, and the .out file for the Linux operating system was converted to a .exe file for the Windows operating system. 


The original artifact functionality consisted of reversing a binary file to the C++ language using the Bless Hex Editor. The binary file was translated to assembly, and was prepared for being converted to C++. The C++ language file was then converted to a .out binary file for the software product to be executed on Linux systems. The compiler used when reverse engineering the original binary files was the GNU compiler, which is suited for Linux systems. The original artifact contains several methods: a main method, a ChangeCustomerChoice method, a CheckUserPermissionAccess method, and a DisplayInfo method. These methods are not reusable and contain object-oriented practices. In addition to reverse engineering, the purpose of this project was to verify the authentication and authorization of a user's account when a user purchases a product online. The functionality of this artifact is illustrated below.
