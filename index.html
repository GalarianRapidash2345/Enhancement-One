<h1>Software Design/Engineering</h1>
  
<p>This artifact is for the Software Design and Engineering category. 
  The artifact created is the combination of Project One and Project Two that performed reverse engineering of assembly language to C++ and created a .out file to execute the projects from CS 410: Reverse Engineering. 
  The artifact consists of a multitude of files that demonstrate proficiency in reverse engineering criteria of the Software Design and Engineering category. 
  The original artifact was created in April of 2021. This artifact was determined to be later within the program, which shows commitment to enhancing more advanced projects. 
  The enhanced artifact contains the conversion of C++ to C and the Linux .out file to a Windows .exe file.</p>
